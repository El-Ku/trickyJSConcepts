//  IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a function that is defined 
//  and then immediately invoked (called)

(function() { console.log("iife with normal function");})();
(() => console.log("iife with arrow function"))();

/* Why use IIFE?

- Everything inside the function is private â€” no variables leak outside.
- Useful before let and const existed (when var was the only way and had function scope).
- Great for initializations, like config, caching, or module setup.
