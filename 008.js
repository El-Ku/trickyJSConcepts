/*

TypeError: foo is not a function

Why?

function foo() { ... } is hoisted first and fully defined at the top of the scope as a function.
var foo is hoisted next, but only the declaration is hoistedâ€”not the assignment (foo = 10). Initially, foo is the function.
(function declarations take precedence)
